# LumiPet

‚ú® **LumiPet** is an **Open Source Desktop Pet for Linux** that lives on your desktop, interacts with you, and reacts to various factors like CPU usage, weather, and system temperature. Users can **easily add their own OCs (Original Characters)** with custom animations and reactions.

In the future, LumiPet will include **Machine Learning and LLM integration** to make your pet smarter and more personal.
